# c2: counts trainers with 6-10 new enrollments - Integer
# c3: counts trainers with 11-15 new enrollments - Integer
# f: returns to "Crunchy_Trainers_Records.txt" used to write to the file - File Object  
# i: loop counter, counts and asks user for 15 inputs - Integer
# name: stores trainer last name input - String
# num: stores new enrollments input - Integer
